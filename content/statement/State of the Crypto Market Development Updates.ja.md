## Q&A

>There is no mention of a re-working of the whitepapers.
>Should this not be a priority so that your marketing that has started has
reference material.
>This is a technical coin and so the documentation needs to be up to date.

Everyone is so busy.

We are trying to get a technical writer, to just produce content and write
articles around the info-graphics we did.

>Why is it only one decimal point change in the coin?
>All other coins have 6 to 8 decimal points.

1 decimal place means ~$0.30

We will enable 2 decimal places when Skycoin hits $10. We can enable the full 6 eventually.
