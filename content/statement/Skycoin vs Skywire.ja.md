Skycoin and Skywire are two separate components of the Skycoin Project.Skycoin is the blockchain. Skywire is the [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking).
Skycoin was built first. It can stand on its own. It was created to addressproblems that Bitcoin has. The biggest problem that Bitcoin has is mining,which leads to the centralization of Bitcoin. The other problems that Bitcoinhad mostly related to cryptography or software bugs, leading to problems suchas [transaction malleability](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability).
Skycoin developed a new consensus algorithm called [Obelisk](https://www.skycoin.net/whitepapers)that eliminates mining (or other alternatives such as[Proof-of-Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)).This is what the [whitepapers](https://www.skycoin.net/whitepapers) are about.The consensus algorithm uses a web-of-trust mechanism to secure the network.Each node in the network has a small listed of trusted peers.You share blocks with each other. If there's bad blocks, such as a block thatcontains a [double spend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending),you reject it and so do your trusted peers. There can be many maliciousnodes in the network, but it will have no impact if you do not trust them.
Skywire was developed to address problems with the internet itself. There aremany [attack points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking) especiallyfor governments since they have large control over the infrastructure.But also large ISPs are pretty bad to their customers.All of these problems are due to the centralization of the internet.
Skywire itself can operate without Skycoin. It would not be the first meshnetsoftware out there. There have been several attempts at building meshnetsbut none of them have grown very large, because it has been an all-volunteer effort.By integrating Skycoin with Skywire, individuals can earn money for runningthe internet, instead of large ISPs. This is the only sustainable path fordemocratizing the internet infrastructure. In addition, the skywire network hasmuch higher security and privacy than the current internet.
Any kind of application that works over the internet, can also work overSkywire. Videos, file storage, VPNs, all of it. Using Skywire will be free,but users can pay nodes in the network for forwarding their traffic, to receivebetter bandwidth and priority service. This provides long term demand forSkycoins. Initially, the Skycoin Project will use some of the undistributedcoins to subsidize operators of nodes on the Skywire network, to get it going.Over time, the subsidy will be replaced by users drawn to the network for theapplications that run over Skywire.
The Skycoin blockchain and the Skywire network are able to stand on their ownwithout the other, but mutually benefit together.  Skywire provides a utilitypurpose for Skycoins, and Skycoin provides a financial incentive to expand theSkywire network.
